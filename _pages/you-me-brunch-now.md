<p style="text-align: left;">Brunch is an important part of the queer community. So important it's at the top of the Gay Agenda. Actually, it's the only thing on the Gay Agenda. We have brunch to discuss the agenda, but after pitchers of mimosas, we really don't care, other than making sure Brunch is still on the agenda for the next week.</p>
