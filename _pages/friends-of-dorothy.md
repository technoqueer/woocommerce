Back in the early days, gay men admired Judy Garland and her most famous character - Dorothy Gale from 'The Wizard of Oz'. Her status as a gay diva rose to gay icon after her death on June 22, 1969 - just twelve days after her 47th birthday. But is was her funeral on June 27th that truly made her more than a dive or icon. It is believed by many that the deep emotions of patrons at The Stonewall Inn was behind the infamous riot in the early morning of June 28th, which became a rallying call for all queers to rise up against our aggressors.

And who could deny another fictional Dorothy her divaness? Bea Arthur's character, Dorothy Zbornak, was a strong, independent woman of stature. While some (wrongfully) believe she was born a man, her height and her fight were incomparable. She was the rock that the other characters on 'The Golden Girls' clung to in stormy weather. She was the inspiration for a new generation of queers.

You don't have to pick and choose; you can love both Dorothy Gale and Dorothy Zbornak. We at TECHNOQueer are proud to offer you these designs to freely adore whichever you choose, or both if you can't decide between one or the other.
