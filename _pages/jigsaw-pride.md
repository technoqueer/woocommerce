<p style="text-align: left;">The queer community is not made up of a single type. We're not Stepford Wives. We are all different, in many ways. But in the end, we all come together when we need to. There is strength in numbers, strength in diversity, and strength in unity. We are pieces to a puzzle, but until the pieces lock together, united, you wonâ€™t see the big picture.</p>
