Queer folk aren’t just myths, legends, or divas. Some actually write books that people of all sorts read. These are a sampling of these authors, each represented by one of their most well-known works.
If you’ve read some of them – great! Read more. Or better yet, write something that will make you a recognized queer author!</p>
