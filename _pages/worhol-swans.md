<p style="text-align: left;">The design is an homage to a certain late out gay pop artist - Andy Worhol. We chose swans to represent two things: the young cygnet in 'The Ugly Duckling,' and Christiana Aguilera's song, 'Beautiful'. Because you are beautiful, no matter what they say. Our words, and our designs, are intended to lift you up, not bring you down. And as a reminder that you aren't an ugly duckling - you are beautiful, and an absolutely fabulous swan.</p>
