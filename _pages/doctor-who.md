<p style="text-align: left;">Everybody loves the Doctor. Okay, not everybody. We all have our favorites and ones we can't stand. Same goes for his companions (though I suspect it's more of a jealousy issue than true hatred). How can you not love Captain Jack? Or Alonzo? Or Rory Williams? I mean, the actor who portrayed them are all openly gay. I'm sure any one of you would be glad to jump into a phone booth with one of them. Or all threeâ€¦ From what I've heard, "it" gets bigger on the inside.</p>
