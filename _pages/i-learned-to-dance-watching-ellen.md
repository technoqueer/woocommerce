Many of us learned to dance by watching Ellen Degeneres. Her unconventional style makes us realize there’s no one way to dance. Just move to the music, and don’t worry if others are watching.
The design is based on the colors of the gay pride flag, with silhouettes inspired by the Monty Python 'Ministry of Silly Walks'. Except each figure is actually of Ellen. Dancing.
