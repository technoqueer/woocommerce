<p style="text-align: left;">The queer community just wants to co-exist with everybody else. We never asked for conflict, battle, or war. We never asked for more rights than any other person. There are as many similarities between queers and straights as there are differences. Same goes for within the queer community. It doesn't make one weaker. On the contrary. Our differences give us strength.</p>
