<p style="text-align: left;">We are people, not letters. We are not an alphabet soup, either. It is the personal belief of TECHNOQueer that the GLBT/LGBT/ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ divides us. It keeps us from standing strong together. United. In the face of the adversary we have to deal with every day, it's important to have a shared identity. And that starts with the most important identity of all - that of self. Nobody can define you except you. It begins with I. I am. I amâ€¦_____. I can't fill in the blank. Only <em>you</em> can tell the world who you are. No other labels matter.</p>
