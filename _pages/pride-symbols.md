<p style="text-align: left;">Symbols have always been important to human societies. They were a means of identifying. Of knowing friend from foe. Of recognizing another who was like you. While the queer community as a whole has the rainbow Pride flag, subsets have their own symbols of identity.

Here at TECHNOQueer, we see all aspects of queerness to be part of nature. Sexual orientation is the safety valve for overpopulation. And humans are too complex to change gender at will like fish and some amphibians and reptiles can. So we've reimagined some of the symbols as derived from nature - leaves mainly. We'll be adding more as time allows, so keep checking back if we don't yet represent your tribe.</p>
