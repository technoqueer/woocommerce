<p style="text-align: left;">A gayly adorned face peers out from this original design, though most of it fades in with the background. You sense a kinship, a similarity. That the face belongs to somebody like you. Call it Gaydar if you must, but it’s rarely wrong. Though sometimes you see what they aren’t ready to accept about themselves.</p>
