<p style="text-align: left;">In the old days of the modern queer community, a code phrase to identify oneself as gay – or to question somebody else if they are -was to say “I am a friend of Dorothy”. The reference was to Dorothy Gale from ‘The Wizard of Oz’ of course, and to Judy Garland.
In more modern times, a new Dorothy appeared to capture the hearts of the queers. Dorothy Zbornak from ‘The Golden Girls’.
So, show your love and your queerness with this great design!</p>
