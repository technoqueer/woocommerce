<p style="text-align: left;">Queer pride re-imagined. Being gay is as natural as trees. So why not reflect that in our pride for ourselves? Scan a maple leaf, replicate it, then apply each of the six colors of the Gay Pride Flag to the copies. Make a nice pinwheel formation with them, and emblazon each with the word PRIDE. The result is a beautiful way to express pride in one's self.</p>
