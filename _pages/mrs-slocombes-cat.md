<p style="text-align: left;">It’s been revealed (without much surprise), that Donald Trump had been recorded saying some rude, crude, lewd things about women. It wasn’t “locker room banter”. It is rape culture. Let Trump and his supporters know that what he said isn’t funny, isn’t acceptable, and will not be tolerated.
Especially by the queen of pussy jokes.</p>
