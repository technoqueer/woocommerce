<p style="text-align: left;">The last song Freddie Mercury recorded was "The Show Must Go On". Brian May was concerned that Freddie's rapidly declining health would make it impossible for Freddie to sing. Freddie's response was, "I'll fucking do it, darling." And he did. But more than that; he ensured he would live forever, long after his body was gone. </p>
