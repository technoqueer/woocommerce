Judy Garland. Diva and gay icon. Her portrayal of Dorothy in The Wizard of OZ won more than just the hearts of queers; she won their gratitude and dedication. Because so many gays associated OZ with a better world, where they saw her as a beacon to that far off magical land. A land of TechnoColor, emeralds, witches (bitches), and just plain fabulousness. Judyâ€™s death and funeral (held on March 27th) may have been a trigger for the infamous Stonewall Riots, considered by many to be the start of the modern gay rights movement.
