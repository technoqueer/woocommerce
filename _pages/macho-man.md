<p style="text-align: left;">Macho Man. How could you ever doubt that a cowboy, a policeman, a construction worker, a soldier, a biker, and an Indian could ever be anything BUT macho? I mean, they couldn't be pansies in disguise, could they? Nah. These men are butch. With manly mustaches. And hairy chests. Fairies can't grow hair on them at all, right?</p>
