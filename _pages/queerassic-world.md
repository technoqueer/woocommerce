Starting with the recovered DNA of a Tyrannosaurus Rex, we filled in the gaps with the genes of Charo and the recently identified “gay genes”.

We now have the very first out, queer, and absolutely fabulous drag dinosaurs. Guaranteed not to reproduce (though no guarantees they won’t try!). Yes, they will be competitive, and bitchy, and will scratch each others’ eyes out – literally. But, in the end, it’s all for the glamor and fame. Just hope they don’t break a nail.

Our star is outfitted with a glorious Gucci Cuchi Coo hot pink hand bag. So, please welcome Tyrannosaurus Regina, queen of the terrible transvestite lizards!</p>
