<p style="text-align: left;">The Village People. Disco sensation. With such hits as 'Y.M.C.A.,' 'Macho Man,' 'Go West,' their music would survive the test of time. When other disco groups vanished, people still remember the Village People. And of course, they still remember all the words to every song.</p>
