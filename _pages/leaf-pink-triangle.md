<p style="text-align: left;">During World War II, and the Nazi's Third Reich, queers were rounded up and placed in the concentration camps. They were forced to wear a pink triangle as identification. Like the Jewish prisoners, they were also executed.

In memory of those who were slaughtered, often without names, and not remembered by history, the queer community has claimed the pink triangle as an emblem of our personal pride. This modern design uses a leaf for the triangle.</p>
