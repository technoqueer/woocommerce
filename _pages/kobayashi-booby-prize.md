<p style="text-align: left;">The dreaded Kobayashi Maru test, the ultimate no-win scenario. It’s not about winning, it’s about how well you handle the situation knowing you’ll fail. One man passed the test (though he cheated), and got command of a starship. After that, anybody who managed to win the no-win scenario got a booby prize.

Sometimes, even life in the Federation isn’t fair.</p>
