Welcome to TECHNOQueer's blog. Here you'll find information on our latest designs or products, advance notice of upcoming sales, and special discount codes to save you money.

As we are still setting up shop, we'll save you the design updates for now, since everything being added is new to you. However, we would like to alert you to our current sale.

Since we missed this year's Transgender Day of Remembrance (March 31st), we have all of our Transgender Pride products marked down 5%. Since who you are is natural, even if your body doesn't match the person you know yourself to be, we like to use nature in our interpretation of pride. This design was given a thumbs up by the Executive Director of the Transgender Education Network of Texas (TENT). We hope you like it as well. This discount will be in effect until June 30th. Next year the discount will be for the entire month of March.

It celebrates the uprising at Stonewall Inn in New York City on June 28, 1969 - considered the start of the modern day gay rights movement. Starting May 15th, all products under the <a href="https://technoqueer.com/shop/shop/pride/">Pride</a> section of our shop will be discounted 5% through the end of June. This allows you time to stock up on Pride gear before the parades, festivals, and parties. But wait - there's more…

<a href="https://technoqueer.com/shop/shop/other/friends-of-dorothy/friend-of-dorothy-gale/" rel="attachment wp-att-1483"><img src="https://technoqueer.com/shop/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/btn-friend-of-dorothy-gale.png" alt="" width="200" height="200" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1483" /></a>Judy Garland. Judy was born on June 10th, and died on June 22nd (<em>not the same year, of course</em>). Judy's funeral on June 27, 1969 may have been the trigger which gave the patrons of Stonewall Inn the courage to stand up to the police early the next morning. Judy, who played Dorothy Gale in 'The Wizard of Oz,' was admired and loved by the queer community. So much so that we had a code phrase. Simply as somebody you're interested in, "Are you a friend of Dorothy?" - an affirmative meant they were gay, too. Yippee! No word whether that worked in Kansas, though…

To honor and celebrate Judy Garland's life and contribution (albeit unknown to her) to our community, we will have our '<a href="https://technoqueer.com/shop/shop/other/friends-of-dorothy/friend-of-dorothy-gale/">Friend of Dorothy Gale</a>' products marked down 5% for the entire month of June.
